This is the readme for:
"data.csv" in RankingBored


In data.csv
each column is as follows:

ID: the ranker's ID
wholeTime: Time spent on task
condition: 0 is animal, 1 is invisible
passTest: whether preRank was passed
gender: gender
age: age
race: race from given options
racetext: self-fill-in "other" race option
ethnicity: Hispanic or Not Hispanic
language: language spoken
languagetext: self-fill-in "other" language option
fluenttwo: If you are fluent in two languages
samp1.id: ID of the judged response #1
rate1: rating given among 5 answers for samp1.id
samp2.id: The same as samp1./id
rate2: same as rate1
samp3.id
rate3
samp4.id
rate4
samp5.id
rate5

!!!IMPORTANT!!!IMPORTANT!!!
_________________
This is 21 columns. 
But if you look at the number of columns in the entries in data.csv each has 25 columns. 

1. "condition" is missing from these entries. You can tell the condition if after samp1.id comes a None then a number OR a number then a None.

If None comes in a column BEFORE the rating, that means animal responses WERE NOT rated. Invisible responses were rated. The entry's condition is 1.
If None comes in a column AFTER, that means Invisible responses were not rated. Animal responses were rated. The entry's condition is 0.

2. The 5 "None"s should have been removed from these entries. I realized there was a way to condense the entries we receive without them but the previous data needs to be reformatted. Future runs will follow the 21 column format above.
